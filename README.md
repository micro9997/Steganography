# Steganography
LSB Image Steganography

&nbsp;

### Introduction

*Steganography is a data-hiding technique used to hide a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.*

*Though there are different possible methods available, here I would go with digital steganography in an image.*

&nbsp;

### Methodology

*Image file formats are standardized means of organizing and storing digital images. Image files are composed of digital data in one of these formats that can be rasterized for use on a computer display or printer. An image file format may store data in uncompressed, compressed, or vector formats. Once rasterized, an image becomes a grid of pixels, each of which has a number of bits to designate its color equal to the color depth of the device displaying it.*

*The BMP file format (Windows bitmap) handles graphic files within the Microsoft Windows OS. Typically, `BMP files are uncompressed, and therefore large and lossless`. their advantage is their `simple structure` and wide acceptance in Windows programs.*

*This project expects us to Encode a message such a way that the quality of the image doesn't change much. So we can do encoding of bits from the message in the LSB of the RGB data.*
